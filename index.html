[ANCHOR INTRO]
Eula Mae Jackson (humor=${humor}, absurdity=${absurdity}, investigative=${investigative}):
"Good evening, y’all. You’re tuned into WNR Alabama 205, where we report what the others are too afraid to whisper. Tonight's story might rattle your shutters and your sensibilities."

Pastor Dave Hargrove:
"We bring it to you not out of fear, but out of faithful obligation. What’s happening in our county isn’t just strange—it’s prophetic."

[MAIN STORY]
The topic of the hour: ${topic}. It began with a report from a livestock auction, but quickly spiraled into something else entirely. Residents describe voices coming from feed troughs, livestock walking backwards, and one elderly man who claims to have been elected by a council of chickens.

${loreInsert}

Eula Mae:
"It’s not just talk. We’ve received grainy footage. Whether it’s hoax, hysteria, or heresy—we’ll let you decide, but you need to see this."

[FIELD REPORT]
Clarice LaFontaine:
"I’m standing here near the remains of what used to be the community gazebo. The air is thick. Heavy. Local dogs won’t come near, and the only sound for the last hour has been a faint radio tune that isn’t coming from any known source. The town sheriff arrived, then left. He didn’t say a word."

Clarice continues:
"A child approached me earlier. She asked if I'd seen 'the copy of the preacher with no eyes.' She left before I could respond. There are symbols in the mud—repeating patterns like weather marks, but older. Much older."

[ANCHOR RETURN]
Pastor Dave:
"These are the signs, friends. This isn't just a prank. This is Revelation with a zip code. The beast doesn’t always arrive in the form we expect."

Eula Mae:
"We’ll keep digging. Whether it’s government interference or something deeper in the dirt, WNR will be here. Watching, whispering, warning."

[CLOSING]
Pastor Dave:
"And should the trumpet sound before dawn, you’ll know we tried."

Eula Mae:
"Goodnight, y’all. Keep your radios close and your candles closer."
